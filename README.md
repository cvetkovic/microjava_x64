# MikroJava Compiler (x86-64)

MikroJava is a lightweight programming language suitable for usage in both basic and advanced compiler construction university courses. It is a strongly-typed object-oriented programming language.

The compiler uses static single assignment (SSA) form to implement global optimizations, as well as for uninitialized variable detection.

The following optimizations were implemented:
- Dead Code Elimination (mark-sweep algorithm)
- Function Inlining
- Loop Invariant Code Motion
- Local Value Numbering
- CFG topology optimizer

<!--This project was submitted as partial fulfillment of the requirements for the bachelor's degree at the University of Belgrade, School of Electrical Engineering.-->
